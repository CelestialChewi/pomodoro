## Pomodoro Timer

##### This is just a personal project which allows me to increase my productivity during my study/work

## There are 5 parts in this main.py which are:-
1. Variables
    * This is where you can set your own work and break timer
2. Reset Timer mechanism
3. Start Timer mechanism
    * In my programme I set my long break at 8 reps and short break for each work session done, you can set any number you like. For example if you want to have long break after 2 work sessions, change the if statement from 8 to 4 or if you want short break for each 4 work sessions, change the elif statement from 2 to 4.
4. Countdown mechanism
    * After you have done a work session, it shows a check mark on screen
5. UI Setup

#### Please run this in Pycharm thou
